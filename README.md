# AdvancedDataScienceFinalProject

## Introduction

This project was designed to demonstrate our knowledge of data science which includes obtaining data from a study, pre-processing that data into a usable form, analyzing the data and designing a shiny web app that can be powered by the data, displaying useful figures that describe and filter the data, train a classifier on the data, and finally make a prediction using that classifier. Overall, this process well encapsulates standard procedures with data and visualization that are used to make well-corroborated conclusions that would be reconcluded if the same raw data were given to another group. This is an essential part of data science.

## Data

Our project specifically uses data from 250 participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 150 without CKD. The data contains 24 features plus the classification feature (whether the participant has CKD). Of these, 11 are numeric (e.g. BMI=20.4) and 14 are nominal (e.g. red blood cells=[normal, abnormal]). The features include age, blood pressure, specific gravity, albumin, sugar, red blood cells, pus cell, pus cell clumps, bacteria, blood glucose random, blood urea, serum creatinine, sodium, potassium, hemoglobin, packed cell volume, white bloodcell count, red blood cell count, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,  coronary artery disease, appetite, pedal edema, anemia, and finally CKD. This data is from Dr. P. Soundarapandian M.D. et al. (2015).

## App Description

Live App Link: https://vrose9.shinyapps.io/Chronic_Kidney_Disease_Final/#section-data-overview

This app plots data of patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and makes a prediction of CKD given data using a classifying model on the CKD data.

Package requirements: methods(4.0.3), stats(4.0.3), utils(4.0.3), grDevices(4.0.3), graphics(4.0.3), datasets(4.0.3), base(4.0.3), flexdashboard(0.5.2), shiny(1.6.0), leaflet(2.0.4.1), reshape2(1.4.4), tidyverse(1.3.0), shinyWidgets(0.6.0), dygraphs(1.1.1.6), magrittr(2.0.1), dplyr(1.0.5), ggplot2(3.3.3), plotly(4.9.3), randomForest(4.6-14), DT(0.17), ROCR(1.0-11)

System Requirements/Environments: This App compiled in R (4.0.3) with RStudio.cloud but will also work with desktop versions of RStudio.


How-to-Use Documentation provided in the app (see app link above).

## How-to

RStudio Cloud:

1) Click the three dots next to "New Project" and choose "From Github".

2) Enter the web address of the repository.

3) Open CKDprediction.Rmd

4) Click "Run Document".


Desktop:

1) Clone the Github Repository on your machine (varies by machine, visit https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository for help)

2) Open RStudio

3) Open CKDprediction.Rmd

4) Run Document

## Example

See How-To run app section above.

Then, follow the instructions below:

Data Visualization
1) Select data to display on the left hand side (such as age = 42 to 55)
2) Click "Display"
3) Use page tabs to choose what type of visual you wish to see.

Prediction
1) Click "Prediction" in top tab
2) Enter data in the left tab to be used in the prediction (such as age = 42)
3) Click "Predict"
4) Results displayed in the right panel
